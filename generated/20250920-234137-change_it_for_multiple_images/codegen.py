To handle multiple images in your code, you'll need to modify your approach to process each image individually. Below is an example of how you can adapt your code to work with multiple images. This example assumes you're working with a list of image paths or file objects.

### Example for Multiple Images

#### Using OpenCV (Python)
```python
import cv2
import os

def process_images(image_paths):
    for image_path in image_paths:
        # Read the image
        image = cv2.imread(image_path)

        if image is None:
            print(f"Could not read image: {image_path}")
            continue

        # Process the image (example: convert to grayscale)
        gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

        # Save or display the processed image
        output_path = os.path.splitext(image_path)[0] + "_processed.jpg"
        cv2.imwrite(output_path, gray_image)
        print(f"Processed and saved: {output_path}")

# Example usage
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]  # List of image paths
process_images(image_paths)
```

#### Using PIL (Python)
```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def process_images(image_paths):
    for image_path in image_paths:
        try:
            # Open the image
            image = Image.open(image_path)

            # Process the image (example: convert to grayscale)
            gray_image = image.convert("L")

            # Save the processed image
            output_path = os.path.splitext(image_path)[0] + "_processed.jpg"
            gray_image.save(output_path)
            print(f"Processed and saved: {output_path}")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {image_path}: {e}")

# Example usage
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]  # List of image paths
process_images(image_paths)
```

### Key Changes for Multiple Images:
1. **Loop through images**: Use a loop (e.g., `for` loop) to process each image in a list of image paths.
2. **Error handling**: Add error handling to skip or log issues with individual images.
3. **Output paths**: Generate unique output paths for each processed image (e.g., append "_processed" to the original filename).

### Notes:
- Replace `image_paths` with your actual list of image paths or file objects.
- Adjust the processing logic (e.g., `cv2.cvtColor`, `image.convert`) based on your specific needs.
- If you're working with a directory of images, you can use `os.listdir()` to get all image files in a folder.
