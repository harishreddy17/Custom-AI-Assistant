Here's a simple code snippet in Python to add two numbers:

```python
# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
number1 = 5
number2 = 7
result = add_numbers(number1, number2)
print(f"The sum of {number1} and {number2} is {result}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `add_numbers` function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum.
2. **Example Usage**: We define two numbers (`number1` and `number2`), call the function with these numbers, and print the result.

### Output:
```
The sum of 5 and 7 is 12
```

You can also write this in a more concise way without a function:

```python
# Direct addition
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
sum_result = num1 + num2
print(f"The sum is {sum_result}")
```

### Output:
```
The sum is 12
```
