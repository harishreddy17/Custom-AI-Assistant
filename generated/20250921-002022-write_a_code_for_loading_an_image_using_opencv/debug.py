# Loading an Image Using OpenCV

Here's a simple Python code example to load an image using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2

# Load an image from file
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

# Check if the image was loaded successfully
if image is None:
    print("Error: Could not load the image.")
else:
    # Display the image
    cv2.imshow('Loaded Image', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)  # Wait for a key press to close the window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # Optionally save the image
    # cv2.imwrite('output_image.jpg', image)
```

## Alternative Versions:

### 1. Loading in grayscale:
```python
image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
```

### 2. Loading with alpha channel (if available):
```python
image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
```

### 3. Using a webcam instead of file:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 is usually the default camera

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to grab frame")
        break

    cv2.imshow('Webcam', frame)

    # Press 'q' to quit
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Notes:
1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed (`pip install opencv-python`)
2. Replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file
3. The image will be displayed in a window that can be closed by pressing any key
4. For webcam capture, you may need to adjust the camera index (0, 1, etc.)
